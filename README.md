# Test Doubles

Test doubles are a fundamental concept in software testing, particularly in unit testing. They are used to replace real objects or components with simplified versions that mimic their behaviour, allowing developers to isolate the unit under test and control its dependencies. Test doubles help in writing maintainable, reliable, and efficient tests.

## 1. Definition:

- A test double is an object or component that stands in for a real object or component during testing.
- It is used to simulate the behaviour of the real object in a controlled manner.
- Test doubles are commonly used when the real object is difficult to set up, slow, or has external dependencies.

## 2. Types of Test Doubles:

### Dummy:

- A dummy object is passed around but never actually used.
- It is used to fulfil parameter requirements of a method or constructor.
- Dummies have no behaviour and are usually just placeholders.

### Stub:

- A stub is an object that provides predefined answers to method calls.
- It replaces a real object with a simplified version that returns hardcoded responses.
- Stubs are used to control the behaviour of the unit under test by providing known outputs for specific inputs.

### Fake:

- A fake is a lightweight implementation of a real object.
- It has a working implementation but takes shortcuts to simplify its behaviour.
- Fakes are often used to replace external dependencies, such as databases or network services, with in-memory implementations.

### Mock:

- A mock is an object that verifies the behaviour of the unit under test.
- It defines expectations on how the unit should interact with its dependencies.
- Mocks track the calls made to them and can assert that the expected interactions occurred.

### Spy:

- A spy is a variation of a stub that also records information about how it was called.
- It allows the test to verify that certain methods were called with specific arguments.
- Spies are useful when you want to ensure that the unit under test interacts with its dependencies correctly.

## 3. Benefits of Test Doubles:

- Isolation: Test doubles isolate the unit under test from its dependencies, allowing focused testing of the unit's behaviour.
- Control: Test doubles provide control over the behaviour of dependencies, enabling testing of different scenarios and edge cases.
- Speed: By replacing slow or resource-intensive dependencies with test doubles, tests can run faster and more efficiently.
- Reliability: Test doubles eliminate the reliance on external factors, making tests more reliable and reproducible.
- Maintainability: Test doubles help keep tests clean and maintainable by reducing the setup and teardown complexity.

## 4. Best Practices:

- Use test doubles judiciously and only when necessary. Overuse can lead to brittle and less meaningful tests.
- Prefer using real objects whenever possible to ensure that the tested behaviour matches the production code.
- Keep test doubles simple and focused on the specific behaviour being tested.
- Avoid sharing test doubles across multiple tests to maintain test independence and isolation.
- Regularly review and update test doubles as the codebase evolves to keep them in sync with the production code.

## Summary

Test doubles are a powerful tool in the software testing arsenal. By using dummies, stubs, fakes, mocks, and spies strategically, developers can write robust, maintainable, and efficient tests. Test doubles enable isolation, control, and speed in testing, leading to higher-quality software and increased confidence in the codebase.
